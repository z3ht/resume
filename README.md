Andrew Darling
=========================

Thanks for visiting my GitHub resume page!

For more information about me, consider also looking at some of the repositories I am most proud of: [silver mind](), [the executioner](), and [moving pose]().

You can also connect with me at `andr3w.darling@gmail.com`. I am `open` to any possible opportunities and am especially interested in doing meaningful work in modernizing education and mental health services!
