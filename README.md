Andrew Darling
=========================

Thanks for visiting my GitHub resume page!

For more information about me, consider also looking at some of the repositories I am most proud of:
- [silver-mind]()
- [executioner]()
- [moving-pose]()

I am `OPEN` to any possible opportunities and am especially interested in doing meaningful work that modernizes education and mental health services! As long as I am provided with enough money to live, I do NOT care about pay - only impact.

Feel free to connect with me at: [andr3w.darling@gmail.com]()

#### Technical Interests
- Proving code correctness
- Predictions with incomplete information
